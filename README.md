Sends imessages to specified people on a specified date, using Google Sheets API

## Introduction

As someone who held multiple leadership positions in college, I was constantly setting reminders for myself to remind others at a future date. Or, if I needed to send a follow-up message in a couple of weeks, so I would set a reminder for myself to send that follow-up. 

It felt inefficient, and I wondered if there was a way for me to just schedule-send the follow-up now, just like the capabilities in emails, but through iMessages. 

This was possible; I created a way for myself to input the name of a person I would like to send a message to, the date I needed it sent, and the message into a simple Google Sheets, and with AppleScript, I was able to schedule the message to be sent through my iMessages on that date. It was pretty cool and it saved a lot of time!

## Production value

This project could not be scaled to work for anyone, as it used my personal phone number and configuration to send out the messages.
